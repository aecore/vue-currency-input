# Vue Currency Input
Vue Currency Input allows an easy input of currency formatted numbers based on the [ECMAScript Internationalization API (ECMA-402)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat).

Powered by the [Vue Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html), it provides the function `useCurrencyInput` (a so called *Vue composable*) for decorating input components with currency format capabilities.
